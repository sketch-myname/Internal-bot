**Among other things, it will be there**:

- `All Internal Games Played` - number of player's games. (**?**)
- `Hits` and `Headshots` - show all player's hits and headshots at other players. (**?**)

- `Overall Score` - player's points for kills, bringing flags, etc - will be compatible with CTF + TS. (**?**)
